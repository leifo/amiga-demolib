WHAT IS THE IFF LIBRARY ?
-------------------------

The iff.library is an easy to  use  Amiga  library  which  gives  you  some
powerful routines to deal with IFF files, especially ILBM files (pictures),
ANIM files (animations) and 8SVX files (digitized sounds).
It was fully written in Assembler and is  only  3.2 KBytes  long.  The  de-
compression routines are the fastest I've ever written :-)
To use iff.library, copy it to the 'LIBS:' directory of your boot partition
or Workbench disk.
Since the iff.library is a standard Amiga library,  it can be used from any
programming language such as C, C++, Modula-2, Assembler, Pascal, ARexx and
many more.

I started writing this library in September 1987, and now it is really bug-
free (I hope) and it can handle any IFF files I know, including DPaint pic-
tures with stencils, HAM and halfbrite pictures, ANIM files (with a trick),
SHAM, AGA and 24bit pictures, SoundFX instruments, and all other IFF FORMs.
