FEATURES
--------

- Plays Movie animations (Created with Sculpt 3D/4D or DILBM/PILBM) and
  ANIM5 animations (Videoscape, DPaint...).

- Runs from both Workbench and CLI, creates an AppIcon under Kickstart 2.x

- Uses double-buffering for best results

- Is fully multi-tasking compatible!



REQUIREMENTS
------------

MoviePRO requires the arp.library and, of course, the iff.library. These
two files should be located in the LIBS: directory.

Currently, MoviePRO requires 10 KBytes of stack. Make sure you set this
stack size in EVERY animation's icon, or a guru will visit you!

Note: This is only a beta release and has many bugs! Beware!



WORKBENCH USAGE
---------------


Under Kickstart 1.3:

  Select all animations you wish to view while pressing the SHIFT key, then
  double-click the MoviePRO icon.

  You can also set the animation's default tool to MoviePRO using WorkBench's
  'Info' feature. You must set the stack size to at least 10K in the icon.
  If you wish to display all the animations in a drawer, select the drawer,
  and while depressing the SHIFT key, double-click the MoviePRO icon. This
  works even with disk icons!
  If a drawer or disk contains another drawer, the animations in that drawer
  will also be displayed.


Under Kickstart 2.x:

  Under Kickstart 2.x you have an additional possibility, which you may
  prefer once you are familiar with Kickstart 2.x: You can put MoviePRO in
  your WBStartup drawer. When you boot your Amiga, MoviePRO is automatically
  started and creates an "AppIcon". This icon looks like any other icon, and
  you can freely chose it's name and it's position (see below). But this
  icon has an interesting feature: You can view an animation by simply
  dragging the icon of that animation on MoviePRO's AppIcon. This works for
  drawers and disks too, of course.
  If you wish to remove the MoviePRO AppIcon, simply start MoviePRO again.


Tool Types:

  MoviePRO understands several tool types. You can edit them using the
  "Show Information" or "Info" commands from the Workbench menu. Here's
  a list of the recognized tool types:

  ICONXPOS     Specifies the x coordinate of MoviePRO's AppIcon. This works
               only under Kickstart 2.x and above.
               Example: ICONXPOS=620

  ICONYPOS     Specifies the y coordinate of MoviePRO's AppIcon. This works
               only under Kickstart 2.x and above.
               Example: ICONYPOS=120

  ICONNAME     Specifies the name of MoviePRO's AppIcon (Only Kickstart 2.x).
               Example: ICONNAME=Animation Player

  OPTIONS      Here you can specify several options, in the same format as
               if you would enter them from CLI. Works under 1.3 too.
               Example: OPTIONS=ALL LOOP 5 NOOVERSCAN

  TASKPRI      If you have a slow processor or a complex animation, MoviePRO
               needs more processor time to display the animation in the
               desired speed. If you set TASKPRI to some value higher than 0,
               MoviePRO will run slightly faster. Note that in this case
               you should not run any time-critical software (such as terminal
               programs) while playing animations. TASKPRI can be set to any
               value between -128 and 127.
               Example: TASKPRI=50



CLI USAGE
---------


The template is:

Patterns/...,ALL/s,C=CONTINUOUS/k,L=LOOP/k,T=TIMING/k,NO=NOOVERSCAN/s,V=VERBOSE/s

MoviePRO <patterns> [ALL] [CONTINUOUS num] [LOOP num] [TIMING jiffies]
         [NOOVERSCAN]


Example: MoviePRO Anim/* Sculpt/foo.anim CONTINUOUS 32000 TIMING 3


patterns       can be any number of file names, directories or disk names.
               All of the ARP wildcards can be used. (?,*,#?,...)

ALL            if this keyword is specified, animations in sub-directories
               will also be shown.

CONTINUOUS n   This determines how many times the animation is displayed.

LOOP n         With LOOP you can specify how many times the animation is
               played, but not continuously. This is for animations which
               are not designed as endless-loop-animations.

TIMING n       specifies the delay between the frames of the animation, in
               jiffies. Note that if you have a complex animation or a slow
               processor, values lower than three (3) are not guaranteed to
               give the desired results.

NOOVERSCAN     display all animations in the size of the Workbench screen, and
               never in overscan. This is not very useful ;-)

VERBOSE        This is only for debugging and should never be used.



KEYS AND MOUSE-BUTTONS
----------------------

While an animation is displayed, you can press the following keys:


LEFT MOUSE BUTTON

  Display the next animation. If there are no more animations to show,
  MoviePRO closes its window and terminates.
  If in AppIcon mode, MoviePRO closes its window and waits for new animations.


RIGHT MOUSE BUTTON

  Abort immediately


Ctrl-C (if the MoviePRO window or the CLI window is active)

  Abort immediately


Ctrl-E (if the MoviePRO window or the CLI window is active)

  If you started MoviePRO from Workbench, ore enabled the "ALL" option from
  CLI, pressing Ctrl-E will skip all animations in the current sub-directory,
  and return to the parent-directory (like in the CLI "Dir" command).
