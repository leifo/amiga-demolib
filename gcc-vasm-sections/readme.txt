- minimal example for chip-sections with vasm and vscode-amiga-debug (https://github.com/BartmanAbyss/vscode-amiga-debug)
- still needs fixing with vscode-amiga-debug to actually put the sections to chip
- copper-list defined in asm, shows green screen if working (or only chip available), otherwise OS default colour

- needs vasm installed, expects it at $(VBCC)/bin/vasmm68k_mot
-- usually c:\VBCC
-- as installed by http://server.owl.de/~frank/vbcc/2017-05-18/Install-VBCC.exe see https://www.dig-id.de/amiga/framework/#subsec_vbcc_setup_on for docs) 
- also needs asm-includes, should have come with the above
